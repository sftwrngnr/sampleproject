This directory contains the server and client for cross container
synchronization. The server accepts as a parameter, the number of containers to
be synched. The client (which need to be installed with the container and run
prior to whatever process(es) need to be executed simultaneously.

The server will fork itself and wait for the semaphore to be updated to the
correct number of containers, then set the "launch" semaphore and wait for the
container semaphore to reach zero before exiting.
